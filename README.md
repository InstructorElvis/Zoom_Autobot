# Zoom_Autobot
This will contain the source code for using Python to schedule for Zoom Calls. Never be late to a call again. 

Note: You will need to modify some settings. This "ReadMe" file will be updated to eventually include the settings specifications for this to work seamlessly. 

Note: Students current working with InstructorElvis will be receiving these "setting" specifications in-class.
